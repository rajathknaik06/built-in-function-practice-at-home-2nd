""" Dhruv wants to write a program to slice a given string based on user-defined start and end positions. 



The program should check whether the provided positions are valid and then return the sliced portion of the string if the positions are within the string's length.

Input format :
The first line consists of the input string as a string.

The second line consists of the start position (0-based index) as an integer.

The third line consists of the end position (0-based index) as an integer.

Output format :
The output displays the following format:



If the start and end positions are valid, print the sliced string.

If the start and end positions are invalid, print "Invalid start and end positions"."""

input_string = input()
start = int(input())
end = int(input())

result_string = ""

input_length = 0
for char in input_string:
    input_length += 1

if 0 <= start <= end < input_length:
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        result_string += input_string[i]
    print(result_string)
else:
    print("Invalid start and end positions")
